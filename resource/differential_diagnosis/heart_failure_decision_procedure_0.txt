Title: Decision Procedure for Diagnosing Chronic Heart Failure

Start

#QUESTION #1#: Are there risk factors present (e.g., history of MI, arterial hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse, CKD, cardiotoxic chemotherapy, family history of CMP or sudden death)?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #2#
  - No: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #2#

#QUESTION #2#: Are there symptoms or signs of heart failure (e.g., breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling)?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #3#
  - No: YOU DON'T HAVE heart failure

#QUESTION #3#: Is the ECG abnormal (e.g., AF, Q waves, LV hypertrophy, widened QRS complex)?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #4#
  - No: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #4#

#QUESTION #4#: Are NT-proBNP levels ≥ 125 pg/mL or BNP levels ≥ 35 pg/mL?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #6#
  - No: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #5#

#QUESTION #5#: Despite normal NT-proBNP/BNP levels, is heart failure still strongly suspected, or are these biomarkers unavailable?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #6#
  - No: YOU DON'T HAVE heart failure

#QUESTION #6#: Does echocardiography show abnormal findings (e.g., abnormal chamber size, LVH, regional wall motion abnormalities, etc.)?
  - Yes: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #7#
  - No: YOU DON'T HAVE heart failure

#QUESTION #7#: Is the LVEF ≤ 40%?
  - Yes: YOU HAVE Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)
  - No: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #8#

#QUESTION #8#: Is the LVEF between 41-49%?
  - Yes: YOU HAVE Heart Failure with mid-range Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF)
  - No: #PROCEED TO QUESTION #9#

#QUESTION #9#: Is the LVEF ≥ 50%?
  - Yes: YOU HAVE Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
  - No: YOU DON'T HAVE heart failure
