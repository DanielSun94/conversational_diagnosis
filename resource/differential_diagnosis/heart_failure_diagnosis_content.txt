SECTION Key steps in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure

The diagnosis of CHF requires the presence of symptoms and/or signs of HF and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1). Typical symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling (Table 6). Symptoms and signs lack sufficient accuracy to be used alone to make the diagnosis of HF.63–66
The diagnosis of CHF is made more likely in patients with a history of MI, arterial hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiotoxic chemotherapy, and in those with a family history of CMP or sudden death.
The following diagnostic tests are recommended for the assessment of patients with suspected chronic HF:
Electrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG makes the diagnosis of HF unlikely.63 The ECG may reveal abnormalities such as AF, Q waves, LV hypertrophy (LVH), and a widened QRS complex (Table 7) that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of HF and also may guide therapy.Measurement of NPs are recommended, if available. A plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) <35 pg/mL, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) <125 pg/mL, or mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) <40 pmol/L68 make a diagnosis of HF unlikely. These will be discussed in more detail in section 4.2.69,70Basic investigations such as serum urea and electrolytes, creatinine, full blood count, liver and thyroid function tests are recommended to differentiate HF from other conditions, to provide prognostic information, and to guide potential therapy.Echocardiography is recommended as the key investigation for the assessment of cardiac function. As well as the determination of the LVEF, echocardiography also provides information on other parameters such as chamber size, eccentric or concentric LVH, regional wall motion abnormalities (that may suggest underlying CAD, Takotsubo syndrome, or myocarditis), RV function, pulmonary hypertension, valvular function, and markers of diastolic function.16,71A chest X-ray is recommended to investigate other potential causes of breathlessness (e.g. pulmonary disease). It may also provide supportive evidence of HF (e.g. pulmonary congestion or cardiomegaly).


FIGURE 1 Algorithm Interpretation
TSuspect Heart Failure when there are:

Risk factors present
Symptoms and/or signs of heart failure
Abnormal ECG (electrocardiogram)
NT-proBNP and BNP Measurements:

If NT-proBNP is ≥ 125 pg/mL or BNP is ≥ 35 pg/mL, proceed with the diagnostic process. If the measurements are below these thresholds and heart failure (HF) is not strongly suspected, heart failure is unlikely.
If heart failure is still strongly suspected despite normal NT-proBNP/BNP levels, or if these biomarkers are unavailable, proceed to the next step.
Echocardiography:

Perform echocardiography to look for abnormal findings. If findings are normal and HF is not strongly suspected, heart failure is unlikely.
If abnormalities are found on echocardiography, proceed to confirm the diagnosis.
Confirm Heart Failure and Define Phenotype:

If heart failure is confirmed, define the heart failure phenotype based on LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) measurement:
LVEF ≤ 40% indicates Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF).
LVEF between 41-49% indicates Heart Failure with mid-range Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF).
LVEF ≥ 50% indicates Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF).
Final Steps:

After the phenotype is determined, identify the etiology of heart failure and commence appropriate treatment.
